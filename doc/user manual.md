Users of this sketch are able to cycle through the different states according to the diagram in the README.md.
After connecting the traffic light to power it will start blinking yellow.
With the push of the button it will switch to 'normal operation mode':

red -> red/yellow -> green -> yellow -> red

Pressing the button at anytime will stop the cycle, pressing again resumes.
Holding down the button for longer will bring the traffic light back to yellow blinking mode.

After some time with no interaction the traffic light will turn off.
