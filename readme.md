# TrafficLight
TrafficLight is a project for learing how to structure a software assigment. It consists of arduino source code, the trafficLight library and the documentation.
With the right hardware (3 LEDs and a pushbutton) it can simulate a traffic light.


# Functionality
- traffic light hardware operations inside the libraray
  - sd

# How to use
  - Copy the library folder into the Arduino library directory to use it inside the Arduino IDE.
  - Connect the three LEDs and the pushbutton to an ardunio of your choice.

  - By constructing a trafficlight instance in a scetch you define the pins used for the LEDs and the button:<br>
[green_LED, yellow_LED, red_LED, button_pin] --> see traffic_light_arduino scetch inside src
